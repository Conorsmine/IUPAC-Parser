# IUPAC-Parser
An API to parse chemical compounds in form of the IUPAC-Nomenclature and receive a Graph-like representation of the molekule.  
This API is under development and currently in its planning phase.  
Any help and suggestions are greatly appreciated. You can view the current plan [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CU87aOPM6Ni6Kc8Y2j5dhfz-78SnOmhoKKU5ZI-HrUQ/edit?usp=sharing) and are welcome to comment and provide feedback.  

Note: The google doc is in german, I hope google translate is proficient enough to translate everything.
